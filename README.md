# GettingCleaningData_project Repository
Repository contains R code (run_analysis.R), code book (code_book.txt), and
readme (README.md) for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

#First you must download the Samsung data, decompress (unzip) the data, and
change your working directory to the parent directory containing the unzipped
data files. Please see the README.txt file within the UCI HAR Dataset directory
for details on the contents of the Samsung data and file structure.

The following commands can be used to download, unzip, and set the working
directory:
download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUC
I%20HAR%20Dataset.zip", destfile = "./dataset.zip")
unzip("./dataset.zip")
setwd("./UCI HAR Dataset")

#Next the data is read into R using read.table(). This is performed for:
features.txt->contains the labels for the data set variables
train/subject_train.txt->contains the subject IDs for the training set data
train/y_train.txt->contains the activity IDs for the training set data
train/X_train.txt->contains the training set data for all the variables
test/subject_test.txt->contains the subject IDs for the test set data
test/y_test.txt->contains the activity IDs for the test set data
test/X_test.txt->contains the test set data for all the variables

###Part 1: Combine data into one data frame
Data frames were created for the training and test data sets. These were
generated by column binding the subject IDs, activities, and variable data.
The training and test data frames were then combined into one large data frame
by row binding.
Column names were added using the variable names available from the features.txt
file.

###Part 2: Filter on columns which contain 'mean' or 'std'
Use grepl() to remove columns which do not contain mean or std

###Part 3: Replace activity IDs with activity descriptions 
Use sub() to replace activity IDs with activity descriptions from
activity_labels.txt.

###Part 4: Label the data set with descriptive names.
Use sub() and gsub() to rename column names with tidy-like easy to read labels.
This includes using camelBack naming, removing hard to read characters, and
adding more descriptive labels
to allow for easier reading of the variable names.

###Part 5: Create a second tidy data set from the output from part 4.
Use reshape2 library for functions melt and dcast to include the mean of the
variables for the observations for each subject and activity performed by that 
subject.
Print out tidy data set using write.table() using row.name=FALSE.
